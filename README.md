# Multi-Time-Series-Prediction
This repository serves to investigate ways to forecast time series or sequences using different tools. 

## Two cultures of prediction
Generally, there are two kinds of situations when a need to be predicted. 
1. The sequence is composed of strong signal with a little noise.
2. The sequence is noisy with just tiny amount of predictable information contained in it.

A typical example of the first kind is Natural Language Processing. In this case, the underlying structure is complicated and "heavy tools" (like LSTM) is needed to deal with it.

For the second kind, we can either use robust machine learning tools (SVM, linear models) or predict with simulated distribution.
